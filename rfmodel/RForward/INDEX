Subs - TJO subroutines
SimpleModel - layer over a half space model
	(good for testing utilities)

Response - codes to perform a forward calculation (G Randall)

Program in ./Decon
	pwaveqn - normalizing equalization program F Domain

Programs in ./Utilities

envelope - calculate the envelope of a function
gradmod - compute TJO format velocity models
	  with gradients 
gradperb - same as above but add random velocity
	    perturbations on the gradient.
manyvsmpl - reads in a list of TJO velocity models
	    and outputs evenly space SAC files 
	    (original name + 's')
modelgen - generate velocity models by perturbing
	   an initial input model using cubic perturbation
	   functions (output as evenly space sac files).
mgentjo - same as modelgen except tjo format velocity structures
	  are output.
vsmpl - same as above but for one at a time 
	(interactive) output file is named 'output'.
rstack - receiver function stacking program (modified
	 from TJO); output stack and stack_var
vplot - velocity model generator which puts 
       depths in as (- Z ) so that the model
       plots vertically
vstack - stacks the evenly spaced velocity models
	 created by manyvsmpl or vsmpl.
modstat - computes statistics on a group
	 of velocity models in TJO format
         and writes them out in a troff format table.
ppstime - calculate the dv vs P - Ps (which is less than 0)
	travel time sac file (vertical incidence)
ptime - calculate 2-way P travel time through a model
	vertical incidence
modtable - generate a troff table for a velocity model

rlowpass - deconvolve one gaussian out and replace with another.

icmod - interactive generation of velocity models for rftn codes.

manyvplot - reads in a list of tjo format velocity models and outputs
            unevenly spaced sac files of vp, vs, rho

other codes are subroutines used by the above
   programs - see the makefiles for details.
