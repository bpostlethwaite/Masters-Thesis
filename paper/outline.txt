- Data and Methods
  - (What is the data)
    - Analysis of bulk Canadian continental crust require parameter estimates
    - Estimates come from processing of seismograms into receiver functions
    - Additional estimates from Crust 2.0 database and an active source compilation.

  - Parameter Estimates from Teleseismic Data
    - P-wave Teleseismic
    - Broadband
    - When 2000 to 2012
    - All networks including CNSN, Polaris, FedNor and Chasme
    - 343 Seismic stations
    - More than 700 EQ sources
    - at each station sources selected if within 30 to 100 degree epicentral distance window
    - Total of 80,000 events
    - Transformed into RFs

  - (How)
    - Two RF transformation algorithms used, one well tested, another not yet employed at scale
    - Both methods utilize the S-wave reflected phases and the travel time difference to the
      direct P-wave arrival
    - [!Figure: Reflected phases]
    - [!Equation: Travel Times]
    - Strong Reflected phases at sharp velocity contrasts, for this study the boundary of interest is the Moho
    - Seperation of P and S wave energy is performed by rotating coordinates into radial and transverse
      dimensions and then transforming them in to P, SV and SH components with a wave field decomposition
      transfer matrix (Bostock, 1998).
    - Direct arrival used as an estimate for the source function and deconvolved from the S-wave
    - Deconvolution approach is an L2 freq domain which preforms quickly and makes no assumptions on
      the noise in the data
    - [!Equation: Deconvolution]
    - Method minimize GCV(r) where r is used as ... explain Equation. (Bostock, 1998; Golub et al., 1979)
    - Decon produces an approximation to the S-component of the Earth's Green's function.
    - This Receiver function has energy located at the times corrisponding to the reflected S-wave arrivals
      in the seismogram
    - RF is filtered between 0.04Hz and 3.0Hz
    - These RF's are used as the data for two parameter estimation methods

    - Vp/Vs method
      - Zhu and Kanamori (2000), hereafter ZK, proposed a method for extracting the ratio, R, of P-wave
        velocity to S-wave velocity, R = Vp/Vs, as well as crustal thickness, H, from receiver functions.
      - Method involves stacking RFs along trial moveout curves for a range of candidate models of R and H.
      - Model requires an apriori assumption on crustal P-velocity, Vp, and will tradeoff to some degree with
        crustal thickness H.
      - Each phase is weighted based on the general trend in quality, with direct arrivals usually carrying
        the best signal followed by the PpPs and finally PpSs.
      - Weights used for all processing are w1 = 0.5, w2 = 0.3, w3 = 0.2 for the Ps, PpPs and PpSs
        phases respectively.
      - The model which stacks the most coherent energy is used to provide the best estimates for R and H.
