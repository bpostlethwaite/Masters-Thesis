BEGIN OUTLINE

- Introduction
  - Broad overview of problem
  - include similar previous work
  - Road-map of paper

- Geological Background
  - Few sentences on each of the major geological regions under discussion in paper

- Data and Methods
  - Analysis of bulk Canadian continental crust require parameter estimates
  - Estimates come from processing of seismograms into receiver functions
  - Additional estimates from Crust 2.0 database and an active source compilation.

  - Teleseismic Data Set
    - Data are Teleseismic
    - Broadband
    - 2000 to 2012
    - All networks including CNSN, Polaris, FedNor and Chasme
    - 343 Seismic stations
    - More than 700 EQ sources
    - at each station sources selected if within 30 to 100 degree epicentral distance
      window
    - Total of 80,000 events
    - Teleseismic Data Transformed into RFs

  - Receiver Function Methods
    - Separation of P and S wave energy is performed by rotating coordinates into radial
      and transverse dimensions and then transforming them in to P, SV and SH components
      with a wave field decomposition transfer matrix [Bostock, 1998].
    - Direct arrival used as an estimate for the source function and deconvolved from the
      S-wave
    - Deconvolution approach is an L2 freq domain which performs quickly and makes no
      assumptions on the noise in the data
    - [!Equation: Deconvolution]
    - Deconvolution method minimizes the general cross validation function GCV(rho)
      where rho is used as the regulation parameter.
      [Bostock, 1998; Golub et al., 1979]
    - Deconvolution produces an approximation to the S-component of the Earth's
      Green's function. This function is referred to as a receiver function.
    - This receiver function has energy located at the times corresponding to the reflected
      S-wave arrivals in the seismogram
    - RF is filtered between 0.04Hz and 3.0Hz
    - These RF's are used as the data for two parameter estimation methods
    - Two RF inversion algorithms used, one well tested, another not yet employed at
      scale
    - Both methods utilize the S-wave reflected phases and the travel time difference to
      the direct P-wave arrival
    - [!Figure: Reflected phases]
    - [!Equation: Travel Times]
    - Strong reflected phases at sharp velocity contrasts, for this study the boundary of
      interest is the Moho

    - Vp/Vs method
      - Zhu and Kanamori [2000], hereafter ZK, proposed a method for extracting the ratio,
        R, of P-wave velocity to S-wave velocity, R = Vp/Vs, as well as crustal thickness,
        H, from receiver functions.
      - Method involves stacking RFs along trial moveout curves for a range of candidate
        models of R and H.
      - Model requires an apriori assumption on crustal P-velocity, Vp, and will trade-off
        to some degree with crustal thickness H. Using the Crust 2.0 Vp estimate at each
        station.
      - Each phase is weighted based on the general trend in quality, with direct arrivals
        usually carrying the best signal followed by the PpPs and finally PpSs.
      - Weights used for all processing are w1 = 0.5, w2 = 0.3, w3 = 0.2 for the Ps, PpPs
        and PpSs phases respectively.
      - Semblance weighting [Eaton, 2006] used to reduce the effect of spurious large
        amplitude noise in the data.
      - [!Equation: Semblance]
      - Semblance function ranges between zero for incoherent noise and one for a coherent
        signal
      - Adding this additional weighting shown by Eaton to provide sharper resolution when
        selecting between stacked models.
      - The model which stacks the most coherent energy is used to provide the best
        estimates for R and H.

    - Vp method
      - Method which allows for estimates of Vp and Vs uniquely [Bostock and Kumar, 2010]
        hereafter BK
      - Does not require apriori assumption on Vp
      - Linear dependence on H in equations can be removed by dividing reflected phases
        with the direct arrival
      - [!Equation: BK travel time equations]
      - Similar to stacking method of ZK, requires an estimate for tps
      - Grid search for R and Vp
      - Line search for H
      - Several methods for choosing tps are available
        - tps should represent the most prominent phase of the ____ and its arrival,
          depending on Moho depth, should fall within the window of 3 to 6 seconds.
          With low moveout one may therefore select the time corresponding to maximum
          amplitude within a given window as an estimate of tps.
        - An alternative approach is to use max amplitude estimates as data in a
          non-linear optimization to find the R, Vp and H which minimize the residual
          between tps and the data. The travel time equations are twice-differentiable so
          the quadratically convergent Newton's method may be employed. This approach has
          the advantage that noise leading to poor maximum amplitude picks are effectively
          collapsed onto the curve corresponding to the travel time function.
        - The problem size is relatively small and performing a full 3D gridsearch over
          Vp Vs and H affords the advantages of both the ZK and BK approaches. No
          requirements for an estimate of tps or Vp and provides estimates for Vp and Vs
          uniquely as well as H. The computational expense can be prohibitive when
          computing a statistically signficant number (1000+) random samples for the
          bootstrap error estimate.

    - Error calculations
      - Error calculations are performed with bootstrap resampling by rerunning the
        processing with randomly selected receiver functions, with replacement, 1024 times.
        The error is obtained by taking the standard deviation of the results

  - Vp database
    - Estimates for Vp and H from compiled active source data
    - Walter Mooney (Personal communication 2012)
    - Provides some information in areas with sparse seismic station coverage

  - Crust 2.0
    - Crust 2.0 provides statistically averaged estimates of Vp, H and in some cases, Vs.
    - Data relies on many sources, active and teleseismic
    - Provides reference values for locally computed estimates

- Results

  - Comparisons
    - Several regional studies have been published that utilize similar method to those
      described above in 2.1, and contain parameter estimates of R and H for some of the
      stations used in this study.
    - Comparisons made using only those stations with less than 0.06 bootstrap error.
    - Ensure processing runs use the correct value for the assumed Vp in respective papers.
    - All comparisons made using ZK approach with semblance weighting

  - Regional Bulk Crustal Parameters
    - All following data has been utilized using only those stations with less than
      than +/-0.06 stdR bootstrap error.
    - Averaging station crustal parameter estimates requires a scheme to account for
      the uneven geographic distribution of stations. Stations that cluster together in
      space should account for less of the total than those stations who are sampling a
      much larger region.
      - A Weighting scheme is calculated as follows:
        - Stations are projected onto the 2D plane using the Albers equal-area conic
          projection.
        - A Voronoi diagram is calculated for all projected station locations.
        - The ratio between the Voronoi cell surface encompassing each station and the
          total area of the bounding region is computed and used as the weighting value.
        - Station parameter values are multiplied by the weights and then summed.
    - [!Figure Histogram Canada H]
    - [!Figure Histogram Canada Poisson]
    - Canada weighted crustal thickness average given by ZK + semblance weighting
      processing is 37.0 km. The weighted value for Crust2.0 is 38km.
    - ??? GIVE ALL SEISMIC PARAMETER VALUES AS POISSON OR VP/VS OR BOTH ???
    - Canada bulk crustal Poisson's ratio is 0.258. The Crust2.0 average is 0.267.
    - For comparison, at 600 MPa a granite gneiss has a Poisson's ratio of 0.250, a
      tonalitic gneiss has a Poisson ratio of 0.257 and a higher value of 0.283 is
      representative of a mafic granulite [Christensen, 1996].
    - The Crust2.0 Poisson's ratio of 0.267 would compare directly to the Poisson's ratio
      of a paragranulite at 600 MPa.
    - [!Figure Histogram Slave, Churchill, Superior, Grenville H]
    - [!Figure Histogram Slave, Churchill, Superior, Grenville Poisson]
    - [!Figure Histogram Churchill, Superior, Grenville Active Source Vp]
    - Slave, Churchill, Superior, Grenville Provinces have weighted crustal thicknesses of
      38.2km, 38.9km, 39.71km and 41.7km and Vp/Vs values of 0.253, 0.250, 0.253 and 0.270
      respectively.
    - Moving South from the Churchill through the Superior and the Grenville see an
      increase in both crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio.
    - The Crust 2.0 values for the same regions are 37.0km, 37.8km, 39.0km and 40.5km for
      crustal thickness and 0.263, 0.264, 0.264 and 0.265 for Vp/Vs.
    - Crust2.0 has shows thinner contintental crusts but the same Southward thickening
      trend.
    - The southern trend of increasing Poisson's ratio values is not as apparent in the
      Crust2 data-set.
    - Using the same weighting scheme, the regional averages for all active source data
      [Mooney, 2012] are compiled. The Vp averages for the three provinces Churchill,
      Superior and Grenville are 6.38km/s, 6.43km/s and 6.48km/s.
    - Active source data shows increasing seismic Vp velocity trend through the
      Canadian Shield, this is in alignment with the trend in Poisson's ratio values
      computed via the semblance wieghted ZK method.
    - [!Figure Histogram Canadian Shield H]
    - [!Figure Histogram Canadian Shield Poisson]
    - The Canadian Shield as a whole has a crustal thickness weighted average of 39.2 and a
      Poisson's ratio of 0.253.
    - The Crust2.0 average values for the Canadian Shield are 38.8km crustal thickness and
      a Poisson's ratio of 0.266.

  - Detailed comparison with Crust2 Data
    - Crustal Thickness Comparisons
      - [!Figure Crust 2.0 vs ZK Crustal Thickness Map]
      - Good overall alignment between the two data-sets:
        - The trend from thicker crust, ~43km, in SE Ontario to thinner crust, ~38km,
          in the NW of the Province.
        - General homogeneous 37+/-2km in the Slave and Churchill Provinces
        - Thicker, 41km+, crusts in the Platform regions,
        - Thinner crusts on the subduction interface on the West Coast of British Columbia.
        - ??? Results from [Perry, 2002] goes into detail on the isostatic composition of
          North America - Can I add anything to the results in this paper? Sparse coverage
          in the cordillera may make this difficult. ???
      - Some noticeable differences in the data-sets:
        - The deeper transect profile running NW to SE on the Churchill side of the
          Great Slave Lake shear zone is absent from the Crust 2.0 data.
        - Most stations in the South of Baffin Island put the Moho more than 4km deeper
          than the Crust 2.0 data.
        - ??? Station ULM & ULM2, best quality, 2km difference than Crust2 data. ???
  - Poisson's ratio Comparisons
    - [!Figure Crust 2.0 vs ZK Poisson Map]
    <<< NEED TO CHANGE OF QGIS FROM VP/VS to POISSONS RATIO >>>
    - Higher variance in the RMS between the two Vp/Vs data-sets than the H data-sets
    - Areas of general alignment are in the Eastern Slave and SE Ontario.
    - Crust 2.0 data gives a value of 1.76 for Churchill and northern Superior Province
      while the ZK computed Vp/Vs values for many of the stations located in these regions
      are much lower, between 7.2 and 7.4.
    - Other lower values for the ZK computed Vp/Vs found in the western Slave Province and
      in the Western Corderilla, along British Columbia's west coast.

- Discussion

  - Comparison Discussion
    - Crustal Thickness
      - Very good correlation in thickness estimates with all three datasets.
    - Vp/Vs
      - Lower correlation with the Vp/Vs values.
        - Expect lower correlation with Vp/Vs since the travel time equations are
          less sensitive to seismic velocities than they are to crustal thickness.
          This means that there will be more uncertainty during the parameter
          search for Vp/Vs and hence higher degree of relative error.
        - ??? Utilizing different sources, applying different deconvolution and
          filtering techniques will therefore have a greater impact on the
          uncertainty of picking Vp/Vs than that of crustal thickness H. ???

  - Explanation of results
    - Canada H & Vp/Vs
      - Lith5.0 (Perry, 2002) estimates for Canadian crustal averages is 38 km. The Crust
        2.0 average is 38km as well, however this is expected since Crust2.0 data for
        Canada is based on the same data as that of Lith5.0
      - ??? Make some comparison to global average ???
