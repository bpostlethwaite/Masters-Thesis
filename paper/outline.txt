- Data and Methods
  - (What is the data)
    - Analysis of bulk Canadian continental crust require parameter estimates
    - Estimates come from processing of seismograms into receiver functions
    - Additional estimates from Crust 2.0 database and an active source compilation.

  - Parameter Estimates from Teleseismic Data
    - P-wave Teleseismic
    - Broadband
    - When 2000 to 2012
    - All networks including CNSN, Polaris, FedNor and Chasme
    - 343 Seismic stations
    - More than 700 EQ sources
    - at each station sources selected if within 30 to 100 degree epicentral distance window
    - Total of 80,000 events
    - Transformed into RFs

  - (How)
    - Two RF transformation algorithms used, one well tested, another not yet employed at scale
    - Both methods utilize the S-wave reflected phases and the travel time difference to the
      direct P-wave arrival
    - [!Figure: Reflected phases]
    - [!Equation: Travel Times]
    - Strong Reflected phases at sharp velocity contrasts, for this study the boundary of interest is the Moho
    - Seperation of P and S wave energy is performed by rotating coordinates into radial and transverse
      dimensions and then transforming them in to P, SV and SH components with a wave field decomposition
      transfer matrix (Bostock, 1998).
    - Direct arrival used as an estimate for the source function and deconvolved from the S-wave
    - Deconvolution approach is an L2 freq domain which performs quickly and makes no assumptions on
      the noise in the data
    - [!Equation: Deconvolution]
    - Method minimize GCV(r) where r is used as ... explain Equation. (Bostock, 1998; Golub et al., 1979)
    - Decon produces an approximation to the S-component of the Earth's Green's function, (receiver function).
    - This receiver function has energy located at the times corrisponding to the reflected S-wave arrivals
      in the seismogram
    - RF is filtered between 0.04Hz and 3.0Hz
    - These RF's are used as the data for two parameter estimation methods

    - Vp/Vs method
      - Zhu and Kanamori (2000), hereafter ZK, proposed a method for extracting the ratio, R, of P-wave
        velocity to S-wave velocity, R = Vp/Vs, as well as crustal thickness, H, from receiver functions.
      - Method involves stacking RFs along trial moveout curves for a range of candidate models of R and H.
      - Model requires an apriori assumption on crustal P-velocity, Vp, and will tradeoff to some degree with
        crustal thickness H. Using the Crust 2.0 Vp estimate at each station.
      - Each phase is weighted based on the general trend in quality, with direct arrivals usually carrying
        the best signal followed by the PpPs and finally PpSs.
      - Weights used for all processing are w1 = 0.5, w2 = 0.3, w3 = 0.2 for the Ps, PpPs and PpSs
        phases respectively.
      - Semblance weighting (Eaton, 2006) used to reduce the effect of spurious large amplitude noise in
        the data.
      - [!Equation: Semblance]
      - Semblance function ranges between zero for incoherent noise and one for a coherent signal
      - Adding this additional wieghting shown by Eaton to provide sharper resolution when selecting between
        stacked models.
      - The model which stacks the most coherent energy is used to provide the best estimates for R and H.


    - Vp method
      - Method which allows for estimates of Vp and Vs uniquely (Bostock and Kumar, 2010) hereafter BK
      - Does not require apriori assumption on Vp
      - Linear dependence on H in equations can be removed by dividing reflected phases with the direct arrival
      - [!Equation: BK travel time equations]
      - Similar to stacking method of ZK, requires an estimate for tps
      - Grid search for R and Vp
      - Line search for H
      - Several methods for choosing tps are available
        - tps should represent the most prominent phase of the ____ and its arrival, depending on Moho depth,
          should fall within the window of 3 to 6 seconds. With low moveout one may therefore select the
          time corresponding to maximum amplitude within a given window as an estimate of tps.
        - An alternative approach is to use max amplititude estimates as data in a non-linear optimization
          to find the R, Vp and H which mimimize the residual between tps and the data. The travel time
          equations are twice-differentiable so the quadratically convergent Newton's method may be employed.
          This approach has the advantage that noise leading to poor maximum amplitude picks are effectively
          collapsed onto the curve corresponding to the travel time function.
        - The problem size is relatively small and performing a full 3D gridsearch over Vp Vs and H affords
          the advantages of both the HK and BK approaches. No requirements for an estimate of tps or Vp and
          provides estimates for Vp and Vs uniquely as well as H. The computational expense is felt computing
          statistical estimates for the error

    - Error calculations
      - Error calculations are performed with bootstrap resampling by rerunning the processing with randomly
        receiver functions, with replacement, 1024 times. The error is obtained by taking the standard
        deviation of the results

  - Vp database
    - Estimates for Vp and H from compiled active source data
    - Walter Mooney (Personal communication 2012)
    - Provides some information in areas with sparse seismic station coverage

  - Crust 2.0
    - Crust 2.0 provides statistically averaged estimates of Vp, Vs and H
    - Data relies on many sources, active and teleseismic
    - Provides reference values for locally computed estimates

  - Comparisons
    - Several regional studies have been published that utilize similar method to those described above in 2.1,
      and contain parameter estimates of R and H for some of the stations used in this study.
