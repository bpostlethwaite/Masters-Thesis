    <!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Seismic studies of the Canadian continental crust predominately analyze specific
      geological features or regions rather than taking a comprehensive and
      comparative inter-regional analysis. The primary reason for this is the poor
      resolution afforded by the seismic networks currently and historically deployed
      across Canada. The Canadian continental landmass is composed of at
      least fifteen large geological provinces as recognized by the Geological
      Survey of Canada (GSC). Each of these regions is itself complex and
      heterogeneous and often larger than most European nations. On top of this
      there is poor seismic coverage, roughly one seismic station per 25,000
      <span
         class="cmmi-12">km</span><sup><span
                                          class="cmr-8">2</span></sup>. Many of these stations are clustered near areas of geologic interest
      such as the Cascadia Subduction zone or population and research centres
      such as Southern Ontario or areas of significant resource interest like
      the diamondiferous Great Slave Lake area. This leaves vast areas of the
      Canadian landmass completely unsampled. Despite these limitations, a low
      resolution comprehensive and comparative study is still feasible for some of
      the geological regions comprising the Canadian continental crust. Direct
      comparison between the bulk average seismic properties of geological
      regions and between aggregated regions and global averages provide some
      new insight into the crustal composition of the Canadian landmass. The
      accumulated dataset also affords investigations into variations of bulk crustal
      parameters such as Poisson&#8217;s Ratio and crustal thickness with age and tectonic
      environment as well as some basic statistical data on interesting crustal
      features.

      <!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   This paper presents a comparative tour through the dataset accumulated from
      processing more than a decade worth of data from all available Canadian seismic
      stations. It begins with a discussion of the raw data itself followed by a review
      of the receiver function method and a more detailed explanation of the
      inversion algorithms used to produce the dataset. Three previous publications
      utilizing similar processing schemes provide unique subsets of data to
      compare with the values computed in this survey for quality assurance.

      <!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >Analysis of bulk Canadian continental crust requires estimates of crustal
      properties such as seismic-wave velocity and crustal thickness. This study draws
      on three sources for these crustal properties. The first and primary source for
      these estimates are data computed by processing raw seismograms into receiver
      functions and then inverting these RF&#8217;s for parameter estimates. The other two
      datasets, the statistically compiled Crust 2.0 dataset and a compilation of
      pre-processed active source data, are used to qualify and compare with the
      primary dataset.

      <!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >The primary data utilized in this study are computed from teleseismic P-wave
      seismograms representing discrete seismic events. These events are comprised of
      seismic records representing more than 700 earthquake sources occuring between
      the years 2000 and 2012 at 343 broadband seismic stations across Canada. Seismic

      stations are selected from all available regional and national networks
      including CNSN, Polaris, FedNor and Chasme. Events are filtered by the
      epicentral distance from source to receiver with only the events within
      a 30 to 100 degree window being included. Seismic events are further
      filtered by hand picking those with reasonable signal to noise ratio and of
      sufficient impulsiveness that arrival times can be accurately measured. After
      selection and filtering more than 80,000 events are available for further
      processing.
      <!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   The first stage of processing requires the transformation of teleseismic data
      into receiver functions. In its generic form this transformation involves
      deconvolving an approximation of the source signal from channels representing
      ground motion. The resulting waveform contains discrete pulses which corrispond
      to arrivals of S-wave energy scattered from subsurface discontinuities. The
      resolution of these pulses has first-order effectsTo gain better resolution of these
      peaks we follow a wave field decomposition approach to To better focus this
      energy the North and East channels are rotated into radial and transverse
      components. Then the radial and vertical components are then decomposed into
      P, SV and SH components with a wave field decomposition transfer matrix
      [Bostock, 1998].
      <!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   Two derivations of receiver function analysis have been used in this study, one
      well tested stacking approach and the other a recent method that has not yet
      been employed at scale. Both methods rely on the fact that the incoming S-wave
      contains energy from the direct arrival as well as reflected phases resulting from
      sharp velocity contrasts. Deconvolution of the P-wave energy arrival, used as an
      estimate for the source function, from the S-wave signal produces a Green&#8217;s
      function with energy peaks at the times of the main and reflected arrivals. For
      better separation of P and S wave energy all components are rotated into
      radial and transverse dimensions and transformed into P, SV and SH
      components with a wave field decomposition transfer matrix (Bostock,
      1998).

      The travel time equations are twice-differentiable so the quadratically
      convergent Newton&#8217;s method may be employed. This approach has the
      advantage that noise leading to poor maximum amplitude picks are effectively
      collapsed onto the curve corresponding to the travel time function. A
      third approach which offers picks along a travel time curve but better
      stability than the non-linear method is to perform a gridsearch with all three
      travel time functions, a full Kanamori stack. With the best estimates

      <!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >The preliminary interrogation of the data set yields the observation that the bulk
      Canadian Shield has lower Vp/Vs than anticipated. Previous experiments show
      crustal averages of 1.77 (Christensen and Mooney, 1995) and 1.78 (Zandt
      and Ammon, 1995). This compares to computed values of 1.73, 1.74,
      1.795 for the Churchill, Superior and Grenville Provinces Vp/Vs ratios
      respectively.
      <!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >   (MIGHT NOT INCLUDE) The data bares out earlier results showing
      Proterozoic crust to have a higher seismic velocity ratio than Archean crust. This
      follows previous studies on crustal formation that have noted this trend in other
      regions (Durrheim and Mooney, 1991) . The increased crustal thickness of
      Proterozoic crust is clearly seen in the active source data while it not visible in
      data from processed seismic stations.
      <!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   Further work on the Bostock-Kumar stacking approach is warranted from a
      look at the cleanest stations. Before it can be employed in large scale analysis
      additional denoising methods or alternative deconvolution techniques will need to
      be investigated to reduce the noise in the data.
