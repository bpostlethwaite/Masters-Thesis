<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Seismic studies of the Canadian continental crust predominately analyze specific
geological features or regions rather than taking a comprehensive and
comparative inter-regional analysis. The primary reason for this is the poor
resolution afforded by the seismic networks currently and historically deployed
across Canada. The Canadian continental landmass is composed of at
least fifteen large geological provinces as recognized by the Geological
Survey of Canada (GSC). Each of these regions is itself complex and
heterogeneous and often larger than most European nations. On top of this
there is poor seismic coverage, roughly one seismic station per 25,000
<span 
class="cmmi-12">km</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sup>. Many of these stations are clustered near areas of geologic interest
such as the Cascadia Subduction zone or population and research centres
such as Southern Ontario or areas of significant resource interest like
the diamondiferous Great Slave Lake area. This leaves vast areas of the
Canadian landmass completely unsampled. Despite these limitations, a low
resolution comprehensive and comparative study is still feasible for some of
the geological regions comprising the Canadian continental crust. Direct
comparison between the bulk average seismic properties of geological
regions and between aggregated regions and global averages provide some
new insight into the crustal composition of the Canadian landmass. The
accumulated dataset also affords investigations into variations of bulk crustal
parameters such as Poisson&#8217;s Ratio and crustal thickness with age and tectonic
environment as well as some basic statistical data on interesting crustal
features.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   This paper presents a comparative tour through the dataset accumulated from
processing more than a decade worth of data from all available Canadian seismic
stations. It begins with a discussion of the raw data itself followed by a review
of the receiver function method and a more detailed explanation of the
inversion algorithms used to produce the dataset. Three previous publications
utilizing similar processing schemes provide unique subsets of data to
compare with the values computed in this survey for quality assurance.

<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >Analysis of bulk Canadian continental crust requires estimates of crustal
properties such as seismic-wave velocity and crustal thickness. This study draws
on three sources for these crustal properties. The first and primary source for
these estimates are data computed by processing raw seismograms into receiver
functions and then inverting these RF&#8217;s for parameter estimates. The other two
datasets, the statistically compiled Crust 2.0 dataset and a compilation of
pre-processed active source data, are used to qualify and compare with the
primary dataset.

 id="x1-50002.1"></a>Teleseismic Data Set</h4>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >The primary data utilized in this study are computed from teleseismic P-wave
seismograms representing discrete seismic events. These events are comprised of
seismic records representing more than 700 earthquake sources occurring between
the years 2000 and 2012 at 343 broadband seismic stations across Canada. Seismic
                                                                          

                                                                          
stations are selected from all available regional and national networks
including CNSN, Polaris, FedNor and Chasme. Events are filtered by the
epicentral distance from source to receiver with only the events within
a 30 to 100 degree window being included. Seismic events are further
filtered by hand picking those with reasonable signal to noise ratio and of
sufficient impulsiveness that arrival times can be accurately measured. After
selection and filtering more than 80,000 events are available for further
processing.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   The first stage of processing requires the transformation of teleseismic data
into receiver functions. In its generic form this transformation involves
deconvolving an approximation of the earthquake source from channels
representing ground motion. The resulting waveform contains discrete pulses
corresponding to the arrivals of S-wave energy scattered from subsurface
discontinuities. Resolving these peaks is essential to the success of the following
inversion, therefore it is advantageous to rotate the seismogram components to
separate the P and S wave energy. This is accomplished by first rotating the N
and E coordinates into radial and transverse dimensions and then performing a
wave field decomposition on the radial and vertical channels [Bostock, 1998]. The
direct arrival of the signal on the resulting P wave component is used as an
approximation to the source function as P waves are simpler and have a
response closer to that of a delta function. This windowed source coda is
deconvolved from the S wave component computed from the wave field
decomposition.

space as positive bands, via Eq. <a

bands intersect will produce a maximum in the stacking function (Fig <a

The model, <span

estimate for the bulk crustal parameters for a given seismic station. The
elongate shape about the point of intersection, with the long axis tilted
mostly in the <span

and <span

<span

signals resulting from complex geology, are quantified by bootstrap resampling
[Efron and Tibshirani, 1986]. Estimates are reprocessed using a random
selection of receiver functions, with replacement, 1024 times. An estimate for
the error is computed by taking the standard deviation from these trial

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-80002.4"></a>Additional data</h4>
<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >Accompanying the processed estimates are data from controlled source
experiments collected and compiled from GSC (Geological Survey of Canada)
references by Walter Mooney (personal communication, 2012). This data provides
<span 
class="cmmi-12">V</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">P</span> </sub> and a few <span 
class="cmmi-12">V</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">S</span></sub> estimates for hundreds of experiment locations across Canada,
many along traversals across geological provincial boundaries, faults and
discontinuities. Some of these data are located within close enough proximity to
seismic stations being utilized in this study that they may be used to
compare with the <span

class="cmmi-8">P</span> </sub> and <span 
class="cmmi-12">V</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">S</span></sub> estimates resulting from the full parameter
gridsearch.
<!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   Whereas the active source data provide high resolution values at specific sites,
the Crust 2.0 model, a global dataset widely cited in academic literature, provides
complete coverage across Canada with an attendant trade-off in resolution. The
data includes estimates of <span 
class="cmmi-12">V</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">P</span> </sub> and <span 
class="cmmi-12">V</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">S</span></sub> for 2<sup><span 
class="cmmi-8">o</span></sup> longitude and latitude cells as well as
information regarding sedimentary thickness and crustal depth. While Crust 2.0
source data is a superset of the aforementioned active source data, the crustal
model is also composed of statistically aggregated data from geographically
distant but geologically similar regions. It therefore forms a unique dataset
well suited for comparison with the crustal estimates calculated in this
study.

provide parameter estimates for <span 
class="cmmi-12">R </span>and <span

Canadian seismic stations. Comparisons between estimates for particular seismic
stations are made for those values which have a corresponding standard error in <span

class="cmmi-8">P</span> </sub> chosen by the study authors and both correlation and mean difference are
calculated (Table <a

<!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >   A comprehensive study in the Hudson Bay region of the Canadian Shield
[Thomson et. al., 2010] employs data from 35 stations, of which, 27 stations share
an error acceptable for comparison in both datasets. There is strong correlation,
0.97, between crustal thickness values (Fig <a

correlation of 0.49 (Fig <a

<a

unexpected.
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   Another study conducted in the Grenville Orogen [Eaton et al., 2006] utilizes
data from 29 stations, with two stations being excluded due to low quality and
high error. Again, there is strong correlation in <span

<!--l. 242--><p class="noindent" >The preliminary interrogation of the data set yields the observation that the bulk
Canadian Shield has lower Vp/Vs than anticipated. Previous experiments show
crustal averages of 1.77 (Christensen and Mooney, 1995) and 1.78 (Zandt
and Ammon, 1995). This compares to computed values of 1.73, 1.74,
1.795 for the Churchill, Superior and Grenville Provinces Vp/Vs ratios
respectively.
<!--l. 245--><p class="indent" >   (MIGHT NOT INCLUDE) The data bares out earlier results showing
Proterozoic crust to have a higher seismic velocity ratio than Archean crust. This
follows previous studies on crustal formation that have noted this trend in other
regions (Durrheim and Mooney, 1991) . The increased crustal thickness of
Proterozoic crust is clearly seen in the active source data while it not visible in
data from processed seismic stations.
<!--l. 247--><p class="indent" >   Further work on the Bostock-Kumar stacking approach is warranted from a
look at the cleanest stations. Before it can be employed in large scale analysis
additional denoising methods or alternative deconvolution techniques will need to
be investigated to reduce the noise in the data.
